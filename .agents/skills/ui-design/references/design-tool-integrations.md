# Design-Tool Integrations (capability-first)

Design tools are **interchangeable, capability-defined integrations**: any tool sits behind the same two capabilities. The
generic protocol always works standalone; per-tool sections below refine it
where a tool's surface is known. A missing tool section never blocks a
strategy — apply the generic protocol. All tool variance stays inside this
skill: **downstream reads only the manifest**, so when any tool's surface
shifts (several are preview-grade), exactly one skill gets patched. Record
what a connected design tool actually exposes on first use (tool names/surface)
in the project's docs — that's the concrete contract and the drift detector.

## The two capabilities

- **Enumerate/export existing designs** (powers Strategy A): list screens/
  frames, fetch a screen's design data (structure, styles, values), yield a
  stable locator.
- **Generate from a system spec** (powers Strategy B): accept design.md
  excerpts + tokens + a screen brief; produce a design artifact with a
  locator.

A tool may have one, both, or neither (neither → it's not a design
tool; Strategy C carries the project).

## Generic protocol

- **Nothing connected, tool wanted**: state it, don't silently downgrade.
  Name the class of tool needed and guide connection via the runtime's own
  MCP mechanism — **check live docs for the current steps** (they're
  runtime-specific and drift; never recite remembered commands). Offer the
  code-native path as the no-blocker alternative; re-verification mode can
  register tool designs later.
- **Discovery**: list the connected MCP's tools; classify against the two
  capabilities; don't assume names.
- **Matching** (Strategy A): find screens by SCR-ID naming in the tool
  (recommend designers put SCR IDs in frame names); otherwise match by
  screen name + surface and **confirm with the user** before registering —
  a wrong registration poisons the manifest. Record the tool-side ID so
  future lookups are exact.
- **Fetching**: prefer structured data (variables, styles, component refs)
  over pixels — values beat inspection. Screenshots are for human
  confirmation and conformance spot-checks, not as the primary source.
- **Generating**: compose the brief from authority (design.md sections,
  tokens, the screen's inventory entry, contract shapes); bounded retry on
  non-conformance; persistent failure → Strategy C for that screen.
- **Locators**: whatever the tool's stable reference is (URL, node ID,
  artifact ref) — verified resolvable before the manifest entry is written.

## Figma

Both capabilities (enumerate/export mature; generation via write-to-canvas).
Strategy A: match frames by SCR-ID naming; fetch via design-context/variables/
styles rather than screenshots where possible; prefer published-library
components as the conformance reference. Locator: file URL + node-id.
Strategy B: write-to-canvas generation exists; treat as preview-grade —
conformance-check output like any generated artifact.

## Claude Design

Generation-first design tool (research preview — surface may shift; keep every
call in this skill). Strategy B: drive with design.md + tokens.json + the
screen brief. Capture the artifact locator it yields. On first use, list its
exposed tools and note them in the project docs as the working contract.

## Figma Make

Generation-oriented (prompt-to-design/app). Stub — refine as usage patterns
emerge: apply the generic generation protocol; its outputs carry an implicit
system, so conformance-check firmly against design.md. If it exposes
enumeration of prior generations, Strategy A applies to those.

## Open Design

Stub — refine as usage patterns emerge. Apply the generic protocol: discover
capabilities first, classify, proceed.

## Unlisted / future tools

Apply the generic protocol. If a tool becomes recurrent, add a section above
recording only what's durable: which capabilities it has, how matching works,
what its locators look like, fidelity quirks — never API minutiae that rot.
