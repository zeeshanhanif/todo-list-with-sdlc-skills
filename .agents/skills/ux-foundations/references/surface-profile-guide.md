# Surface-Profile Guide (the Per-Surface Layer)

Run this once per surface. A profile takes the shared core and specializes it for
one interface's users, navigation, and context. The depth scales with how much
the surface diverges: two web surfaces sharing a component library may need only
a light profile (mostly IA and a few components), while a native mobile app needs
a fuller one (its own component layer, platform conventions, touch model).

Produce these six things for each surface.

## 1. Users and primary jobs

A tight restatement, specialized to this surface: who uses it, in what context,
and the 3–7 jobs they come to do. Pulled from the architecture's actors plus the
per-surface elicitation. This frames every other decision in the profile — an
internal admin used all day optimizes for speed and density; a public site for a
first-time visitor optimizes for clarity and guidance.

**Assign the surface code here.** Each surface gets a short, stable code used in
its screen IDs — e.g., Admin Portal → `ADM`, Public Website → `WEB`, Mobile App
→ `MOB`. Derive it sensibly, confirm with the user, and state it in the
profile's header ("Admin Portal — surface code `ADM`"). With multiple similar
surfaces, disambiguate (`WEB1`/`WEB2` is legal but prefer meaningful codes like
`SHOP`/`CORP`). Codes never change once assigned.

## 2. Information architecture and navigation

The structure of the surface: its top-level sections, how they're organized, and
the **navigation model** appropriate to the surface and its device target —
e.g., a persistent sidebar for a data-dense admin portal, a top nav for a
marketing site, a tab bar for a mobile app. Capture this as a **sitemap** (a
tree of sections and key pages; see the diagram guide). The navigation model is a
real design decision, not a default — choose it from the surface's content
volume and device context.

## 3. Key user flows

For the most important jobs, the end-to-end path the user takes across screens —
e.g., "admin reviews and approves a refund," "visitor signs up and onboards,"
"user places an order." Capture each as a **flow diagram** (see the diagram
guide). Flows reveal the screens and states the surface actually needs and expose
gaps the IA alone won't. Cover the primary happy paths plus the consequential
edge cases (empty states, errors, permission boundaries) for critical flows.

## 4. Screen / page inventory

The catalog of screens for this surface — the **most important handoff in the
whole document**, because implementation planning slices features against it and
the per-slice ui-design step is told which screens to design by reference.

**Every screen gets a unique, stable ID:** `SCR-<SURFACECODE>-<NNN>` (e.g.,
`SCR-ADM-001`, `SCR-WEB-014`), numbered sequentially within the surface. The
same stability rules as requirement IDs apply: an ID never changes or gets
recycled once assigned; amendments add with the next free number, and removed
screens are tombstoned (marked `Removed`), never renumbered — downstream slices
reference these IDs.

List each screen as: ID, name, one-line purpose, and, where useful, its key
states (empty / loading / error / populated) and the core or surface-specific
components it composes. A table works well:

| ID | Screen | Purpose | Key states |
| :-- | :----- | :------ | :--------- |
| SCR-ADM-001 | Dashboard | At-a-glance ops overview | loading, empty |
| SCR-ADM-002 | Orders List | Browse/filter all orders | empty, error |

Organize by the IA sections. Aim for completeness of breadth (every screen a
user can reach) even though each screen's detailed design comes later, per
slice.

## 5. Surface-specific components

The components this surface needs **beyond** the shared core, because its context
demands them. Examples: an admin portal needs data tables with sorting / filtering
/ bulk actions, dashboards, and detail/edit panes; a marketing site needs hero
sections, feature blocks, pricing tables, and CTAs; a mobile app needs native
navigation patterns, pull-to-refresh, and bottom sheets. List them with a one-line
spec, the same way as the core inventory. Be honest about what's genuinely
surface-specific versus what should be promoted into the shared core because more
than one surface needs it.

## 6. Token overrides

Where this surface deviates from the shared tokens, and why — always as
*overrides of named core tokens*, never a fresh palette. Common, legitimate
overrides: larger touch targets and spacing on mobile; a denser type and spacing
scale on a data-heavy admin portal; a more expressive type scale on a marketing
site. If a surface needs no overrides, say so — that's the healthy default and
means the core is doing its job.

## After the per-surface loop

The per-surface profiles feed directly into the cross-surface reconciliation
(shared vs. surface-specific components, cross-surface flows, consistency rules)
covered in the main workflow. Keep a running note, as you profile each surface,
of any component you've now seen on two or more surfaces — those are candidates
to promote into the shared core rather than maintain in parallel.
